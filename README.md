# Opinion Mining
This is the final work for Data Structures (UFRGS), made by [Henry](https://github.com/akahenry) and [MSWLandi](https://github.com/mswlandi).

## Objective
We're supposed to compare the performance of Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and some other balanced tree chosen by the students (AVL, red-black or Splay), in a Sentiment Analysis application. The tree chosen was AVL.

## Application
There will be two files as input: one containing words with a rating (-1 for negative and 1 for positive), separated by new lines, and the other containing movie reviews, written in english, each separated by new lines.
The output will be the number of comparisons used to find each word in the trees, and a file with each sentence's score (sentiment)
